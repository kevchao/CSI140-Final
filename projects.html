        <div  class="projectupdate">

                <b>Update 1</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Started picking out our javascript projects. We can pick between a game called craps, a point of sales
                system, or a content management system. I decided to do the craps game because it seemed like the most fun option to do.
            </p>

        <div  class="projectupdate">
            <p>
                <b>Update 2</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                To start, the game needs a GUI for people to actually interact with. The javascript part will come
                later in the second half of the project.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div  class="projectupdate">
            <p>
                <b>Update 3</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Started working on the look of the game. As usual, the hardest part is making everything
                go in the right spot.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div  class="projectupdate">

                <b>Update 4</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Trying to figure out which inputs I should be using for each part of the game. I need something
                to display text, like the round, bet, point, etc.
            </p>

        <div  class="projectupdate">

                <b>Update 5</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                I only have to do the GUI because the javascript part is optional now. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div  class="projectupdate">
            <p>
                <b>Update 6</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                I got curious about the game and played around with it in Visual Studio. I managed to get up to around 3200 money 
                before I lost. The game seems fun.
            </p>

                <b>Update 7</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Took a break on the project for a bit to work on things for other classes.
            </p>

                <b>Update 8</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Might have gotten lazy and barely did any work on the project
            </p>
        </div>
        <div  class="projectupdate">
            <p>
                <b>Update 9</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                GUI is done, just have to figure out how to put it into the portfolio final. Probably just going to include it as a link to the actual site.
                I'll have to add something saying the project doesn't actually work.

                Finals week is about to roll around, should start getting ready.

            <p>
                I've finished off one of my final exams/assignments, leaving just the portfolio and an exam.

            <p>
                Today's the last day of Spring Quarter. Finals should be just about wrapped up and I can start thinking about
                next year.
